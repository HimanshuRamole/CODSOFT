Task 1: Guess the Number Game

Description:

A simple console-based game where the program generates a random number within a specified range, and the user attempts to guess it.

Features:

Randomly generates a number between 1 and 100.

Provides feedback on whether the user’s guess is too high, too low, or correct.

Task 2: Student Grade Calculator

Description:

A program that calculates the total marks, average percentage, and assigns a grade to a student based on their performance in multiple subjects.

Features:

Takes user input for the number of subjects and marks for each subject (out of 100).

Validates that input marks are within the range 0–100.

Computes:

Total Marks: Sum of all marks entered.

Average Percentage: Total marks divided by the number of subjects.

Grade: Based on average percentage:

A: 90% and above

B: 80%–89%

C: 70%–79%

D: 60%–69%

F: Below 60%

Displays total marks, average percentage, and the assigned grade.
